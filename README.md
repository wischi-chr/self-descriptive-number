Abstract
--------
This computer-assisted proof is related to the
maths puzzle: "The self descriptive number" as
described here by Dr. James Grime (singingbanana)

The puzzle can easily be solved by hand and the
result will very likly be 6210001000 ^^ (for base 10)

I was not sure if this is the only possible solution
so I wrote a naive brute force computer-assisted proof (C# .NET 4)
